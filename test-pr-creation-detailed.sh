This PR demonstrates the fixed PR creation logic in Claude Nights Watch.

**Project:** $PROJECT_NAME
**Daemon PID:** $DAEMON_PID
**Execution Time:** $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC')
**Test Branch:** $BRANCH_NAME
**Target Base:** $original_branch

## Fix Verification
- ‚úÖ Branch created from current branch (not main)
- ‚úÖ Original branch correctly read from file
- ‚úÖ PR targets actual original branch: '$original_branch'
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded 'main' fallback used

## Before Fix
\`\`\`bash
# OLD (broken) logic
local original_branch=\"main\"  # ‚ùå Always defaulted to main
\`\`\`

## After Fix
\`\`\`bash
# NEW (fixed) logic
local original_branch=\"\"      # ‚úÖ No hardcoded default
# Properly reads from file and cleans the value
\`\`\`
