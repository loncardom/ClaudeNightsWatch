**Executed:** $(date)
**Daemon PID:** $DAEMON_PID
**Branch:** $BRANCH_NAME
**Original Branch:** $ORIGINAL_BRANCH

## Simulated Task Results
This file simulates changes that Claude would make during autonomous task execution.

### Changes Made:
- Created this documentation file
- Demonstrated the git workflow
- Tested PR creation with correct base branch

### Git Workflow Status:
- ‚úÖ Branch created from original: $current_branch
- ‚úÖ Changes committed automatically
- ‚úÖ Ready for PR creation on daemon shutdown

This PR was created by the Claude Nights Watch daemon during full workflow testing.

**Project:** $PROJECT_NAME
**Daemon PID:** $DAEMON_PID
**Execution Time:** $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC')
**Branch:** $BRANCH_NAME
**Base Branch:** $original_branch

## Fix Verification
- ‚úÖ Branch created from current branch (not main)
- ‚úÖ Original branch correctly read: '$ORIGINAL_BRANCH'
- ‚úÖ PR targets correct base: '$original_branch' (not hardcoded 'main')
- ‚úÖ Full daemon lifecycle tested

## Changes Made
The changes in this PR were generated during the autonomous workflow test. This demonstrates that the PR creation bug has been fixed.

## Test Plan
- [x] Review automated changes for correctness
- [x] Verify PR targets correct base branch
- [x] Confirm git workflow integration works
