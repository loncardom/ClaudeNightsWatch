**AUDIT COMPLETE**

Task task-008 has been thoroughly audited and **REJECTED** due to complete failure to execute the assigned work. The target file was never accessed, no style issues were fixed, and the task was incorrectly marked as completed despite producing no deliverables. This represents a critical failure in the task execution system that requires immediate attention and infrastructure fixes.
